Custom Printf Function
This project aims to create our own version of the printf function in the C programming language. The function will be responsible for printing formatted output to the standard output (the console).

During the project, we will focus on the following concepts:

Group Projects: Working collaboratively as a team on a coding project.
Pair Programming - How To: Efficiently working in pairs on code development.
Flowcharts: Creating flowcharts to plan and visualize program logic.
Technical Writing: Preparing documentation for the code and project.


Testing
We should work together to create a set of comprehensive tests to ensure the correctness of our custom printf function. We will also compare the output of our function with the standard printf to verify its accuracy.
